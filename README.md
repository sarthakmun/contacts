- **Search Behavior** - Searches across all contact fields simultaneously
- **Loading Simulation** - 1.5-second delay to demonstrate loading states
- **Responsive Breakpoints** - Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Empty States** - Distinct messaging for "no contacts" vs "no search results"

### **Interaction Design**
- **Favorite Management** - Only available in detailed contact modal
- **Avatar Customization** - 24 animal options in organized 6×4 grid
- **Form Validation** - Real-time feedback with proper error messaging
